🚀 Overview

This project was built for the Build with Agentic AI Challenge during the Aman Hackathon.
It is an AI-powered Resume Data Extractor that takes a resume file (PDF) and extracts structured information such as Name, Position, Salary, Department, and more.
The extracted data is displayed in a clean, aesthetic, and user-friendly interface.

🎯 Problem Statement

Manual extraction of details from resumes or employee documents is time-consuming and error-prone.
HR teams, recruiters, and businesses waste valuable hours going through large sets of resumes or forms.
Our solution addresses this challenge by automating data extraction using Agentic AI and IBM watsonx to achieve accurate, consistent, and fast results.

💡 Solution

Upload a resume PDF in the app.

Click Extract.

The AI model processes the file and displays extracted details instantly.

Save or export results in CSV format for HR records.

This eliminates the need for manual review and ensures faster recruitment workflows.

🧠 Agentic AI & IBM watsonx Usage

We leverage IBM watsonx to:

Understand and process unstructured text in resumes.

Automatically identify relevant fields (Name, Position, Salary, etc.).

Structure the extracted data for easy export and integration with HR systems.
